# Installation - Initial

Installation is super easy!

1. First we need to install [pesde](https://docs.pesde.dev/installation/)
   > Pesde is the toolchain and package manager which installs everything else that we may need for us. You can view their instructions on how to install it [here](https://docs.pesde.dev/installation/).
2. Run `pesde install` to install all of the dependencies
3. Run `pesde run config` to build all of the configuration files

> [!WARNING]
> DO NOT use any other toolchain managers like rokit or aftman to install pesde. For reaosns why, please read their documentation.

From here, we have package dependencies which are like libraries we can use in our script. This is faciliated by [wally](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally) which pesde can use. For more information on wally, view their README [here](https://github.com/UpliftGames/wally/blob/main/README.md) then read [this](https://docs.pesde.dev/guides/dependencies/#wally-dependencies).
