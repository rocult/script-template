# Usage - [src/types](../../src/types/)

In this folder, you should put any and all types that may take up a significant part of a regular `.luau` file.

If you need any globals, you can also put the path to the types file into [here](../../.vscode/settings.json). You should put your global type file in [the global_types folder here](../../global_types/).
