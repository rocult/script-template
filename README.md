# Example Project

This is an opinionated project layout, how I think you should layout your projects. View the chapters for each part below.

## Chapters

- [Installation](./docs/installation/INSTALLATION_INITIAL.md)
- [Usage](./docs/usage/USAGE.md)
- [Tools](./docs/tools/TOOLS.md)
- [Workflows](./docs/workflows/WORKFLOWS.md)

## Usage

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure you use `pesde` to install all of the dependencies. Do not use any third-party tools to install `rokit` like `foreman`. Make sure to follow the installation guide for `pesde` carefully!

1. Clone the repository
2. Set the `name` inside of [pesde.toml](./pesde.toml) as `GITHUB_USERNAME/PROJECT_NAME`, replacing the values of course...
3. Follow each [chapter](#chapters), starting with [Installation](./docs/installation/INSTALLATION_INITIAL.md)
